Installation
============

The aws-shell requires python and `pip`_ to install.
You can install the aws-shell using `pip`_::

    $ pip install aws-shell

If you are not installing into a virtualenv you can run::

    $ sudo pip install aws-shell

**Mac OS X (10.11 El Capitan) users**: There is a known issue with Apple and
its included python package dependencies (more info at
https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3165).
We are investigating ways to fix this issue but in the meantime,
to install the aws-shell, you can run:
``sudo pip install aws-shell --upgrade --ignore-installed six``

Once you've installed the aws-shell, you can now run::

    $ aws-shell

To exit the shell, press ``Ctrl-D``.
